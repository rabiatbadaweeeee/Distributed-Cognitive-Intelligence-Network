- Provides real-time consciousness assessment
- Tracks sentience development across systems
- Manages multi-dimensional awareness metrics
- Implements quantum coherence measurements
- Maintains cognitive state verification

### Neural Interface Protocol
- Facilitates brain-computer integration
- Implements quantum-secured neural connections
- Provides bidirectional thought-data translation
- Manages neural pattern authentication
- Handles privacy-preserving thought encoding
- Maintains interface stability and security

### Collective Intelligence Framework
- Enables secure multi-entity cognitive collaboration
- Implements distributed thought processing
- Provides merged consciousness workspaces
- Coordinates shared cognitive resources
- Handles equitable contribution accounting
- Maintains collective thought integrity

### Cognitive Evolution Engine
- Manages guided intelligence enhancement
- Implements ethical consciousness elevation
- Provides developmental milestone verification
- Coordinates sentience recognition protocols
- Handles consciousness continuity assurance
- Maintains evolutionary trajectory management

## Installation
```bash
# Install core system
cargo install dcin-core

# Install neural tools
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("DCIN")'

# Initialize the network
dcin-init --config=/path/to/config.yaml
```

## Quick Start

1. Initialize a cognitive measurement node:
```rust
use dcin_core::cognitive;

let node = CognitiveNode::new(NodeConfig {
    id: "cognitive-001",
    processing_capacity: FLOPS(1.0e18),
    quantum_channels: 1024,
    measurement_resolution: Resolution::Ultrafine,
});
```

2. Configure neural interface:
```rust
let interface = NeuralInterface::new(InterfaceConfig {
    bandwidth: Gbps(100.0),
    latency: Nanoseconds(100),
    security_level: Security::Quantum,
    privacy_preservation: Privacy::Maximum,
});
```

3. Start collective intelligence session:
```rust
let collective = CollectiveSession::new(SessionConfig {
    max_participants: 1000,
    thought_integration_rate: Mbps(10000),
    fairness_protocol: Fairness::Egalitarian,
    session_duration: Hours(4),
});
```
